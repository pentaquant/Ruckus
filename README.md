## Ruckus Movie Database 🎬
# Introduction
Ruckus Movie Database (RMDB) was a project created in an attempt to replicate the presentation and functionality of Rottentomatoes.com.

# 🍿 API Integration 🍿
RMDB uses ([The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en))'s API to pull movie posters, directors, cast, gross revenue, overview, and other details. This API is the lifeblood of the project, allowing us to display hundreds of pieces of information without having to store them within RMDB's database.
